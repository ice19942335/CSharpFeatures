### Local functions (C# Programming Guide)

This particular example is made specifically for: Local functions and exceptions
To demonstrate that:
> One of the useful features of local functions is that they can allow exceptions to surface immediately. For iterator methods, exceptions are surfaced only when the returned sequence is enumerated, and not when the iterator is retrieved. For async methods, any exceptions thrown in an async method are observed when the returned task is awaited.
